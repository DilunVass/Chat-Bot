Question,Answer
What is AWS Cloud?,"• AWS Cloud is a cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services, including compute, storage, databases, security, networking, analytics, machine learning, and DevOps etc... • AWS Cloud is a highly scalable and reliable platform that can be used to build and deploy applications of all sizes and complexity. • AWS Cloud is also a cost-effective platform, as you only pay for the resources that you use."
DOES IT SOLVE?,"MATRIX FROM HELL INCREASES THE COMPLEXITY CONTAINERS REDUCES THE COMPLEXITY IN SUMMARY A CONTAINER IS, • Just an isolated process running on the host machine. And a restricted process. • Will share OS and, where appropriate, bins/ libraries and limited to what resources it can access. • It exits when the process stops. “Containers are the next once-in-a-decade shift in IT infrastructure and process”"
WHAT IS DOCKER?,"• So what’s Docker? – In 2024, Docker means lot’s of things, let’s just clear things out. • Docker as a “Company” • Docker as a “Product” • Docker as a “Platform” • Docker as a “CLI tool” • Docker as a “Computer Program”"
ARE THERE SOLUTIONS OTHER THAN DOCKER?,• Docker – Container runtime + Tool for managing containers and images • Containerd – Container runtime only • Podman – Tool for managing containers and images DEEP DIVE INTO DOCKER INTERNALS DOCKER ARCHITECTURE
Do we understand how/why it makes predictions?,Training Time Important for real-time or big data Fairness
Does it treat all groups equally?,Generalization
Does it perform well on new data?,Explainability
How can we run containers at scale?,"Container orchestration • Container orchestration automates the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of containers. • Container orchestration can be used in any environment where you use containers. It can help you to deploy the same application across different environments without needing to redesign it."
What is Agentic AI?,"Agentic AI: Models that plan, reason, act, and adapt across steps — not just single reply generation. LLM becomes part of a feedback loop rather than a one-shot answer engine.
